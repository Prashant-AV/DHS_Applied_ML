       ">    - Replace 'your_file_path.csv' with the actual path to your 'housePrice' dataset.\n",

       "> \n",
       "> 2. **Feature Selection and Data Splitting:**\n",

       ">    - The target variable, 'price', is stored in 'y'.\n",
       ">    - We use `train_test_split` to divide the data into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets.\n",
       "> \n",
       "> 3. **Model Building:**\n",
       ">    - A `LinearRegression` model is created and fitted (trained) on the training data.\n",
       "> \n",
       "> 4. **Model Evaluation:**\n",
       ">    - We predict house prices for the test data and calculate the R-squared and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) to assess model performance.\n",
       ">      - **R-squared:** Measures the proportion of variation in the target variable explained by the model (higher is better).\n",
       ">      - **MAE:**  Represents the average absolute difference between predicted and actual prices (lower is better).\n",
       "> \n",
       "> 5. **Model Coefficients Interpretation:**\n",
       ">    - The code displays the coefficients of the linear equation learned by the model. Each coefficient indicates the estimated change in house price for a one-unit change in the corresponding feature, holding other features constant.\n",
       "> \n",
       "> 6. **Predictions on Sample Test Data:**\n",
       ">    - We create a small 'sample_data' DataFrame to demonstrate how to make predictions on new data using the trained model.\n",
       "> \n",
       "> **Output:**\n",
       "> \n",
       "> - The output will show you the R-squared, MAE, the model's coefficients, and the predicted prices for the sample data.\n",
       "> \n",
       "> **Key Points:**\n",
       "> \n",
       "> - This code provides a basic framework. You might need to handle missing values, explore feature engineering, or try different regression models to improve accuracy depending on your dataset. \n",
